## How can I collect any unpaid salary from my employer?

If your employer has stopped paying you due to bankruptcy or is otherwise insolvent, it is within your rights to apply for pay security. To qualify, all pay security applications need to be filed within three months of your overdue payment. It should be noted that it can take up to 8 months to process your application.

Legal action may also be required. If you are unsure of what steps to take, it is advised to speak with a lawyer.
